How are these pages linked?

This page will serve as a reminder for a step-by-step guide to do this.  

# First
First thing to notice is that "_pages" include the overarching pages for the blog posts
"_posts" are each post.  


# Uploading
If the page does not upload, look at the history of _config.yml.  That will show us what is changing.

# Adding pages on the top
Change the values in _data/navigation.yml

# getting the projects to the pages
use format of heading above in making markdown document


# H1 heading

normal text

*single \* for italics*

** double \*\* for bold**


For a [link](http://charlesahlstrom.github.io)

Bulleted kuis:
* one
* two 
* three

Numbered:
1. one
2. two
3. three


add a code snippet:


Python code
```python
	import numpy as np

	def test_fn(x,y):
			z = np.sum(x,y)
			return z
```

Rblock code:
```r
library(data.table)
cat("do somthing")

```

Image rules:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/cherry_blossom.jpg" alt="a cherry blossom!">

heres another way:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/endor.jpg)


Here is some math

$$ z = x+y $$
