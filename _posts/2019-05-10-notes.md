How are these pages linked?

This page will serve as a reminder for a step-by-step guide to do this.  

# First
First thing to notice is that "_pages" include the overarching pages for the blog posts
"_posts" are each post.  


# Uploading
If the page does not upload, look at the history of _config.yml.  That will show us what is changing.

# Adding pages on the top
Change the values in _data/navigation.yml
